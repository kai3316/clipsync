# Changelog

All notable changes to ClipSync are documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- "Check for Updates" (GitHub releases) and a versioned About dialog in the tray
- App icon (.ico) for Windows builds
- Quick actions (Show QR / Send URL) in the Overview panel
- Richer telemetry across the UI: status bar, overview stats, device cards, history, transfers

### Changed
- "Aurora Cyber" theme: unified cyan/violet/pink palette across light and dark, glass-morphism surfaces, aurora background glow
- Static assets served with `no-cache` so UI updates appear immediately after restart

### Fixed
- Settings panel and translate modal never registered (bare `t()` calls)
- Device unpair/forget/connect not refreshing the device list
- Tray actions (QR / send-url / settings) dropped when the webview window was not yet open
- Status bar showing stale "sync paused" / wrong connected-device count
- History pagination cursor after batch delete; transfer history missing direction/timestamp
- i18n keys missing from JSON locale files (sort control, update checker)
- Cross-platform: macOS tray wiring for check-update/about, Linux pynput dependency, color-mix fallback, spec icon placement

## [1.0.4] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- Modern web-based UI (WebView) with an in-app UI mode switch (Modern / Classic)
- Favorites panel in the web companion
- Per-device connect/disconnect controls
- Clipboard de-duplication and source tracking
- Durable SQLite-backed clipboard history database
- Send retry for failed clipboard syncs
- Global hotkey support

### Changed
- Version now has a single source of truth (internal/version.py) — pyproject, native About dialog, and web About panel all derive from it
